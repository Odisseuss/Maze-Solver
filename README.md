# Maze-Solver
This is an algorithm which I wrote in Haskell, that takes a maze as an input and returns the solved maze.

The format of the maze is as follows: # is used for the walls, @ is for the player, and the emply places are the corridors.
The "maze" files contain several types of mazes, some bigger , some smaller as denoted in the name
